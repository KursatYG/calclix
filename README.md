# Calclix

**Calclix** is a modern and responsive calculator & converter application built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It includes a variety of useful tools such as a standard calculator, unit converters, and daily-use utilities like BMI and discount calculators.

This project was developed as a personal learning journey to deepen my understanding of modern React patterns, the Next.js App Router architecture, and utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS.
